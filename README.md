### About Meüëã
Hi there! I'm M. Durai Raj, a passionate and innovative Senior Software Developer with 2.8 years of experience crafting modern web solutions. I write code that's not only functional but also scalable and maintainable‚Äîfirmly grounded in SOLID principles.

My core tech stack includes .NET Core, ASP.NET Core MVC, Web API, Entity Framework Core, Vue.js, and SQL Server. I specialize in Clean Architecture, Microservices, and Microfrontend Architecture‚Äîdelivering modular, maintainable systems on both the back end and front end.

Agile by mindset, I adapt quickly to evolving requirements while ensuring high-quality delivery. I‚Äôve led CI/CD automation using Bamboo and Bitbucket, streamlining release cycles and boosting development efficiency. I also bring hands-on expertise in managing IIS for seamless deployments and high-performance web hosting.

I thrive in collaborative environments where ideas spark innovation and teamwork fuels great software. Whether building microfrontends or driving architectural improvements, I aim to create solutions that are clean, powerful, and built to last.!
